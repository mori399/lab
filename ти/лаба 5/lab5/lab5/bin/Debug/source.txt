My name is Kira Yoshikage. I am 33 years old. My house is located in the northeastern part of Morioh, where all the villas are located. I am single. I work at Kame Yu department store and I come home no later than 8 pm. I don't smoke, but I drink sometimes. I go to bed at 11pm and make sure I get exactly eight hours of sleep no matter what. After drinking a glass of warm milk and stretching for about twenty minutes before going to bed, I usually sleep until the morning without any problems. Like a child, I wake up in the morning without any fatigue and stress. At my last checkup, I was told that I didn't have any health problems. I'm trying to convey that I'm an ordinary person who wants to live a quiet life.
